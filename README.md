This project is beneficial for those interested in computer vision and deep learning. The SVHN dataset consists of 60,000 images of house numbers in real-world images. Each image contains a single digit from 0 to 9. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with 6,000 images per class.

## Dataset

This link(" https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/svhn_cropped ") leads to the SVHN Dataset, which is loaded and preprocessed using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets. The dataset is then divided into training and testing subsets for model training and evaluation.

## Dataset Summary

Training set size: 50,000 images
Testing set size: 10,000 images
Number of classes: 10

## Data Visualization and Summary

Number of pixels in the image: Height x Width (e.g., 32x32 pixels)
Number of images per class: 6,000 images per class

## Neural Network Architecture

To describe the architecture of a neural network, specify the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer. Additionally, it's important to mention the activation functions used and their purposes, such as ReLU for introducing non-linearity. Specify whether or not dropout was used and how it affected the model. Finally, it's important to explain the regularization techniques used, for example, L1 or L2 regularization.

## Optimization Algorithms

To evaluate the performance of a neural network, it's important to specify the optimization algorithms experimented with, such as Gradient Descent, Adam, etc. Explain why certain algorithms were chosen over others for this particular task. Additionally, presenting the results clearly and concisely is crucial. Visualize the F1 score for both training and validation sets over epochs. Finally, it's important to report the number of trainable parameters in the final model, along with the calculation for the same.

## How to Use

To get started, clone the repository, install the required libraries specified in the requirements file, and run the main script for training and testing the model. Feel free to experiment with different parameters and architectures by modifying the code.
